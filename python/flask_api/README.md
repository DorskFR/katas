# Flask

Forgot hard how to use Flask after using asynchronous webservers only for a while.

https://flask-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/#api-reference
https://github.com/pallets/flask

## Notable

Routers are called blueprint.

## Extensions

There is an extension to integrate SQLAlchemy in Flask that most projects use instead of using SQLAlchemy directly.

https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/
https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-sqlalchemy

## Objectives

- Simple REST API
- Use sqlalchemy ORM
- CRUD routes
